<h1>freeCodeCamp | JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structure Certification</h1>

<p>This repository contains my project completed as part of the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/sukis/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8">JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structure Certification</a> from <a href="https://github.com/freeCodeCamp">freeCodeCamp</a>.</p>

<h2>Cash Register Project</h2>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>This project involves building an app that returns change to the customer based on the price of the item, the amount of cash provided by the customer, and the amount of cash in the cash drawer. The app also shows different messages to the user in different scenarios, such as when the customer provides too little cash or when the cash drawer doesn't have enough to issue the correct change.</p>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<p>This project was completed following specific instructions provided by freeCodeCamp. The requirements included creating an input element for the cash amount, a button to trigger the purchase, and a display element for the change due. The app ensures that the input is a valid number, checks the cash drawer for sufficient funds, and calculates the correct change to be returned.</p>

<h3>Other Projects</h3>
<p>In addition to this project, I have also completed the following projects as part of the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structure Certification:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Roman Numeral Converter</li>
  <li>Telephone Number Validator</li>
  <li>Palindrome Checker</li>
  <li>Pok√©mon Search App</li>
</ul>

<p>Each project demonstrates various aspects of JavaScript and Data Structures and was completed according to the guidelines provided by freeCodeCamp.</p>
